Perfect — let’s break this down microservice by microservice, very detailed, so you have a clear blueprint to start building.
We will keep this Auth-free version as we discussed, but leave hooks so you can add authentication later if needed.

🟩 Detailed Specifications for Each Microservice
1️⃣ Frontend Service

Tech: React + TailwindCSS, deployed via Nginx (Docker container)

Responsibilities:

Display all pages (Home, Tours, Booking, Contact)

Send API requests to other microservices

Provide a simple and clean UI optimized for tourists

/tours – List of tours (fetched from Tours service)

/tours/:id – Tour details

/booking – Booking form

/contact – Contact form (calls Messaging service)

/gallery – Show photos from Media service

2️⃣ Tours & Packages Service

Responsibilities:

Manage tours (CRUD)

Serve public tour data to the frontend

Endpoints:

GET /tours → list all tours

GET /tours/{id} → get tour details

POST /tours → add a new tour (admin use only for now — we can protect with simple API key header)

DELETE /tours/{id} → delete a tour

Database Table:

Column	Type	Notes
id	UUID	Primary key
title	TEXT	Tour title
description	TEXT	Detailed text

GET /bookings/{id} → get booking details

PUT /bookings/{id} → update status (pending → confirmed)

DELETE /bookings/{id} → delete booking (admin only)

Booking Flow:

Customer submits form on frontend

Booking service saves it in DB

Booking service triggers notification (email or WhatsApp)

Database Table:

Column	Type	Notes
id	UUID	Primary key
customer_name	TEXT	
email	TEXT	
phone	TEXT	Optional
tour_id	UUID	FK → Tours table
date	TIMESTAMP	Travel date
status	TEXT	pending, confirmed
4️⃣ Messaging & Notification Service

Tech: FastAPI + SMTP (Gmail/SendGrid) + Optional Twilio (WhatsApp)

Responsibilities:

Send booking confirmation email to customer

Notify admin of new booking (email or WhatsApp)

Log all notifications sent

Endpoints:

POST /notify/email → send email

POST /notify/whatsapp → send WhatsApp (optional)

GET /notifications → view sent notifications (for debugging)

Email Template Example:

Subject: New Booking Request

Hello [Admin],
You have a new booking request for [Tour Name] on [Date].
Customer: [Name] - [Email].

5️⃣ Media & Gallery Service

Tech: FastAPI + MinIO / Local storage + S3-compatible API

Responsibilities:

Manage all media assets (vehicle photos, destinations)

Provide URLs for frontend

Endpoints:

GET /gallery → list all images

POST /gallery/upload → upload new image (admin use only)

DELETE /gallery/{id} → delete image (admin use only)

Database Table:

Column	Type	Notes
id	UUID	Primary key
url	TEXT	Image path
caption	TEXT	Optional
6️⃣ (Optional) AI Travel Assistant Service

Tech: FastAPI + Llama 3 via Ollama (local)

Responsibilities:

Answer basic questions about tours, pricing, weather, best routes

Recommend itineraries based on number of days and city

Return JSON response with recommended tour IDs (so frontend can link)

Endpoint:

POST /ask
Request:

{ "question": "What can I do in Marrakech in 2 days?" }


Response:

{
  "answer": "You can take our Marrakech City Tour on day 1 and Essaouira day trip on day 2.",
  "suggested_tours": ["tour_001", "tour_002"]
}

🔄 Inter-Service Communication
From → To	Purpose
Frontend → Tours Service	Load list of tours
Frontend → Booking Service	Submit booking request
Booking Service → Messaging Service	Trigger email/WhatsApp notification
Frontend → Media Service	Load gallery images
Frontend → AI Service (Optional)	Get tour recommendations
📡 Port Convention
Service	Port
Frontend (React)	3000
Tours & Packages	8010
Booking & Reservation	8020
Messaging & Notification	8030
Media & Gallery	8040
AI Assistant	8050 (optional)

This setup is fully modular and can run via docker-compose with separate containers for each service.

✅ Benefits of This Detailed Design

Clear separation of concerns – each microservice does one job well

Easier maintenance – can update booking logic without touching tours

Scalable – later you can add authentication, payments, or AI with minimal disruption

Fast MVP – focus on Tours + Booking + Notifications first to start receiving customers

Would you like me to draw a visual architecture diagram (services, ports, arrows) for you to pass to your developers (or even to an AI agent like O3/Lumma) so they can scaffold the services automatically? This will make the structure crystal clear before development.
